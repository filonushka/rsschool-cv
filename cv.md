- ### About me  

During my studies at university, I developed the ability to thoroughly approach any issue and the ability to perform monotonous work. In addition, I have distinct analytical skills and a mathematical mindset. I often find an out-of-the-box approach to solving a difficult problem.  

In my time working in the field of logistics, I improved these skills with practical knowledge.I am sure that I can successfully apply my competencies not only in the field of logistics.  

In my free time, I love to read books (mainly in business literature, psychology, science pop and cookery (mainly in confectionery art). I also love listening to podcasts, singing in the choir and baking pastries (biscuit cakes, cupcakes, cookies, etc.) etc.). At other times,  I go for walks with my dog ​​and discover new cosy coffee shops for heart-to-heart meetings with friends.  

In general, I am a proactive extrovert with an analytical mindset. I am a fast learner with a desire to grow and develop.  

Currently, I am working for one of the biggest online gaming companies Wargaming. This opened my eyes to the world of IT and I have decided to explore it and find my true potential by trying my hand out in JS.
